<h1>Nevada</h1>
<h3>Nevada is a inhospitble place, yet there still is sprawling with life. From animals too cities off sin.
Nevada truely has everything tabo and tempting inside its borders. Las Vegas being the pinicale 
of what people consider "Nevadan". Though the real capital lies far north west off Las Vegas.
Though the real fun is in the south with amazing views like the night lights of Las Vegas or the giant
construct known as Hoover dam. With a rich history and many chances to indulge, will you let 
Nevada be your next vacation spot?

<h1 id="C1">Cities and landmarks</h1>
<h4>Though Nevada is one of the most sparsely populated states in the USA. Yet it still has 
plenty of landmarks to show us. From the hoover dam all the way to Carson city. All these
are way different from eachother. Carson city being the state capital. Even though it being 
the capital the amount of people that live there is 12 times less than in the main city of
Las vegas. Though Las Vegas itself is a city of sin. It's set istelf as a oasis of greed in
vast desert that surrounds it. Many taboo things are encouraged like gambeling and easy to get
alcohol. Las Vegas has been highly oppertunistic in it's pursuit off money. Which made some people
benifit a lot from crime and gang operations. These were rotted out around the 1950s.
