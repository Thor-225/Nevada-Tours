<h3>Nevada is a inhospitble place, yet there still is sprawling with life. From animals too cities off sin.
Nevada truely has everything tabo and tempting inside its borders. Las Vegas being the pinicale 
of what people consider "Nevadan". Though the real capital lies far north west off Las Vegas.
Though the real fun is in the south with amazing views like the night lights of Las Vegas or the giant
construct known as Hoover dam. With a rich history and many chances to indulge, will you let 
Nevada be your next vacation spot?
