     <h3>Did you know?</h3>
    That the National bird of the state of Nevada is the Mountain Bluebird? Due to the structure
    of its feathers it reflects light in a way that makes it blue.

    <p> Other than that the state flower is the Sagebrush. It's crucial to keep many 
    of the plants in the desert alive due to the shadow they provide.

    <h1>Nevada</h1>
    <h4>
      Nevada is an inhospitable place, yet it is still sprawling with life. From animals to cities of sin.
      Nevada truly has everything taboo and tempting inside its borders. Las Vegas being the pinnacle 
      of what people consider "Nevadan". Though the real capital lies far northwest of Las Vegas.
      The real fun is in the south with amazing views like the night lights of Las Vegas or the giant
      construct known as Hoover Dam. With a rich history and many chances to indulge, will you let 
      Nevada be your next vacation spot?

    <h4>
      Though Nevada is one of the most sparsely populated states in the USA, it still has 
      plenty of landmarks to show us. From the Hoover Dam all the way to Carson City. All these
      are way different from each other. Carson City being the state capital. Even though it is 
      the capital, the amount of people that live there is 12 times less than in the main city of
      Las Vegas. Las Vegas is otherwise known as the city of sin. It's set itself as an oasis of greed in
      the vast desert that surrounds it. Many taboo things are encouraged like gambling and easy to get
      alcohol. Las Vegas has been highly opportunistic in its pursuit of money, which made some people
      benefit a lot from crime and gang operations. These were rooted out around the 1950s.
